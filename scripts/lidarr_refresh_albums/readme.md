# lidarr_refresh_albums

After the metadata issue with Lidarr I had a ton of albums that had incorrect information and the metadata server was still having some issues around caching so I wrote this to refresh every single album until they were all up to date.

I know this is a bit of an ugly script but it gets the job done.
