# autohotkey_switch_hdr_on_off
# HDR_Switch.ahk

I wrote this because Sunshine + Moonlight + HDR is not great.

# Instructions
1. Download script
2. Test and verify the script works for you
3. Use Ahk2Exe included with Autohotkey to create a .exe from the script
4. Set Sunshine to call the new .exe before and after streaming that way it turns HDR off for teh stream, then turns it back on
