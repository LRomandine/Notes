# mealie_bulk_image_import

I had a ton of images of hand written recipe cards from family I wanted to import into [mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie) but mealie does not support bulk import of images, only one at a time. This script will attempt to import the recipe one image at a time. 

I used a local Ollama with Gemma3:12b to perform the import, it had around a 80% success rate.
